# Figma Slides Creator

Use this skill for the default workflow: take an existing template and build a new presentation from it. For authoring reusable templates themselves, use `skills/figma-template-builder/SKILL.md`.

## MCP First

In Claude Cowork, use the MCP tools first and keep the workflow inside the plugin.

- Do not inspect the installed `figmatk` npm package just to discover capabilities.
- Do not write ad hoc Node.js scripts when an MCP tool already covers the task.
- Do not fall back to direct library calls for template listing, template instantiation, deck creation, or normal deck editing.

Use direct Node.js or CLI paths only if the MCP server is unavailable or a required capability does not exist in the MCP surface yet.

## Skill Boundary

Use this skill when the outcome is a finished deck for immediate use.

Switch to `skills/figma-template-builder/SKILL.md` when the user wants to:

- build a reusable template
- define layouts or placeholders
- rename slots for future sessions
- derive a new template system from references or examples

## ⚠️ Never open .deck files directly

`.deck` files are binary ZIP archives. **Never open, read, or display a `.deck` file** — it will show garbage bytes in the panel. To inspect or modify a `.deck` file in Claude Cowork, use the MCP tools below.

To let the user view the result: tell them to **open the file in Figma Desktop** (`File → Open` or double-click the `.deck` file).

## Quick Reference

| Task | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Create from scratch | **Path A** — `figmatk_create_deck` MCP tool |
| Create from a `.deck` template | **Path B** — `figmatk_list_template_layouts` + `figmatk_create_from_template` |
| Author a reusable template | Use `skills/figma-template-builder/SKILL.md` |
| Edit text or images in an existing deck | `figmatk_update_text`, `figmatk_insert_image` |
| Clone, remove, or restructure slides | `figmatk_clone_slide`, `figmatk_remove_slide` |
| Inspect structure or read content | `figmatk_inspect`, `figmatk_list_text` |

---

## File locations — always use /tmp

**All files go in `/tmp/`** — scripts, output decks, images, everything. Never write to the Desktop, Documents, Downloads, or any user directory. Never create intermediate notes or reference markdown files. Just build and save the deck.

## Default Workflow

1. Inspect the template or deck.
2. Pick the minimum set of layouts or edits needed.
3. Populate text slots first, then image slots.
4. Save to a new `/tmp/` output path.
5. Sanity-check the result with `figmatk_list_text` or by opening it in Figma Desktop.

---

## Path B — Create from a Template (preferred when user provides a .deck file)

Use this path when the user provides a `.deck` template file. The output deck inherits all fonts, colors, spacing, and visual design from the template verbatim.

### Step 1 — Inspect the template

```
figmatk_list_template_layouts("/path/to/template.deck")
```

Returns a catalog of all available slide layouts. Each entry includes:
- `slideId` — the ID to reference this layout
- Layout state — `draft` or `published`
- Text slots — explicit `slot:text:*` fields when present, otherwise fallback text candidates
- Image slots — explicit `slot:image:*` fields when present, otherwise fallback image candidates
- Node IDs — usable for direct targeting when the template has not been fully annotated yet

**Read the catalog carefully before picking layouts:**
- Prefer layouts with explicit slot metadata when available
- Match each slide's purpose to your content; the existing copy is often the best hint
- Use slot names first, then node IDs, then raw node names when populating content
- If a layout exposes no explicit image slots, treat heuristic image candidates as weaker signals and avoid overwriting decorative sample imagery unless the user clearly wants that

### Step 2 — Create the deck

```
figmatk_create_from_template({
  template: "/path/to/template.deck",
  output: "/tmp/my-deck.deck",
  slides: [
    { slideId: "1:74",  text: { "title": "My Company" } },
    { slideId: "1:112", text: { "header": "The problem.", "body": "Description here." }, images: { "hero_image": "/tmp/problem-photo.jpg" } },
    { slideId: "1:643", text: { "title": "Thank you!" } }
  ]
})
```

Only pass slots or node IDs that exist in the layout's catalog. Extra keys are silently ignored.

---

## Path A — Create from Scratch (MCP tool — no template)

**Always use this path.** No npm install, no scripts, no workspace setup.

Call `figmatk_create_deck` with a structured slide description:

```json
{
  "output": "/tmp/my-deck.deck",
  "title": "My Presentation",
  "theme": "midnight",
  "slides": [
    { "type": "title",   "title": "My Presentation", "subtitle": "A subtitle" },
    { "type": "bullets", "title": "Key Points", "bullets": ["Point one", "Point two", "Point three"] },
    { "type": "two-column", "title": "Comparison", "leftText": "Left side content", "rightText": "Right side content" },
    { "type": "stat",    "title": "By the numbers", "stat": "42%", "caption": "of users prefer this" },
    { "type": "image-full", "image": "/tmp/photo.jpg", "title": "Caption text" },
    { "type": "closing", "title": "Thank you", "subtitle": "Questions?" }
  ]
}
```

### Slide types

| Type | Fields |
|------|--------|
| `title` | `title`, `subtitle` |
| `bullets` | `title`, `bullets` (array) |
| `two-column` | `title`, `leftText`, `rightText`, `image` (right side) |
| `stat` | `title`, `stat` (big number), `caption` |
| `image-full` | `image` (path), `title`, `body` (overlay text) |
| `closing` | `title`, `subtitle` |

### Themes

`midnight` · `ocean` · `forest` · `coral` · `terracotta` · `minimal`

Each theme handles backgrounds, accent colors, and text colors automatically.

---

## Path B — Edit an Existing Deck (MCP Tools)

Use this when the user provides a `.deck` file to modify.

### Workflow

1. `figmatk_inspect` — understand the deck structure (node IDs, slide count, symbols)
2. `figmatk_list_text` — read current text and images per slide
3. `figmatk_list_overrides` — find the override keys for each symbol (what's editable)
4. `figmatk_update_text` — apply text changes
5. `figmatk_insert_image` — apply image changes
6. `figmatk_clone_slide` — duplicate a slide and populate it
7. `figmatk_remove_slide` — mark unwanted slides as REMOVED
8. Always write to a **new output path** — never overwrite the source

### MCP tool reference

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `figmatk_create_deck` | **Create a new deck from scratch** — no npm install needed |
| `figmatk_inspect` | Node hierarchy tree — structure, node IDs, slide count |
| `figmatk_list_text` | All text strings and image hashes per slide |
| `figmatk_list_overrides` | Editable override keys per symbol (component) |
| `figmatk_update_text` | Set text overrides on a slide instance |
| `figmatk_insert_image` | Set image fill override (handles SHA-1 hashing + thumbnail) |
| `figmatk_clone_slide` | Deep-clone a slide with new text and images |
| `figmatk_remove_slide` | Mark slides as REMOVED (never deleted) |
| `figmatk_roundtrip` | Decode + re-encode for pipeline validation |

## Final Checks

Before finishing, prefer at least one of these:

- `figmatk_list_text` on the output deck
- `figmatk_roundtrip` if the deck went through multiple edits
- a manual open check in Figma Desktop when the user is validating upload/render behavior

## Design Philosophy

Think like a **professional PowerPoint designer**, not an AI generating slides. Every deck must feel like it was made by a human who spent a day on it.

### Deck structure — use this template every time

A proper deck has a clear spine. Follow this slide order:

| # | Slide type | Purpose |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **Title** | Dark bg, big title, subtitle, presenter name |
| 2 | **Agenda / Overview** | 3–5 bullet topics, light bg |
| 3–N | **Content slides** | Vary layout each slide — see below |
| N+1 | **Section divider** (optional) | Bold colour block to signal a new chapter |
| Last | **Closing / CTA** | Dark bg mirrors title slide — "Thank you", next steps, contact |

The title and closing slides must use the **same dark background** — this creates the "sandwich" effect that makes decks feel complete.

### Consistent visual motif — pick one and use it on every slide

Choose one repeating element and place it consistently across all content slides:

- **Top accent bar**: `addRectangle(0, 0, 1920, 8, { fill: hex('#...') })` — full-width coloured strip at top
- **Left colour panel**: tall rectangle on the left third, text floats right
- **Corner badge**: small filled circle or square in bottom-right with slide number or logo
- **Bottom rule**: thin full-width line at y=1040

Without a motif, slides look unrelated. With one, the deck feels designed.

### Colour

- Pick a bold palette for the **specific topic** — not a generic one.
- One dominant colour (60–70%) + 1–2 supporting tones + one sharp accent.
- Dark backgrounds on title/conclusion slides, light on content ("sandwich") — or fully dark for premium feel.

**Starter palettes** (use nearest named color for `setBackground`, hex helper for shapes):

| Theme | Background | Shape accent | Text |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------|
| Midnight | `'Black'` | `hex('#CADCFC')` | `'White'` |
| Forest | `'Green'` | `hex('#97BC62')` | `'White'` |
| Coral | `'Persimmon'` | `hex('#2F3C7E')` | `'White'` |
| Terracotta | `'Persimmon'` | `hex('#E7E8D1')` | `'White'` |
| Ocean | `'Blue'` | `hex('#21295C')` | `'White'` |
| Minimal | `'White'` | `hex('#36454F')` | `'Black'` |

### Layout — vary every slide

Each content slide should use a **different layout type**. Never repeat the same structure back-to-back.

| Layout | When to use |
|--------|------------|
| Two-column | Comparison, pros/cons, text + image |
| 2×2 or 2×3 grid | Features, icons, categories |
| Large stat callout | One big number + explanation |
| Half-background image | Photo-rich slides |
| Timeline / steps | Process, history, roadmap |
| Icon + text rows | Lists that need visual weight |
| Full-bleed image | Impact moment, section break |

Every slide needs at least **one visual element** — shape, image, SVG, or table. No text-only slides.

### Typography

- Left-align body text. Centre only titles on title/closing slides.
- Minimum 64px margin from slide edges. 24–48px between content blocks.
- Use `Header 2` or `Header 3` for slide titles on content slides (not `Title` — that's for the title slide only).
- **Body text: max 2 sentences per text block.** Text boxes have fixed heights — overflow gets clipped. If you have more to say, use a bullet list or split across slides.
- **Bullets: max 6 items, max 8 words per bullet.** Longer bullets wrap and push content off-slide.

### Never do

- Repeat the same layout slide after slide
- Centre body text
- Use accent lines under slide titles (hallmark of AI-generated slides)
- Text-only slides
- Low-contrast text against background — **match image tone to slide palette**: dark/moody images on light-background slides make text unreadable; pick a bright image or switch to a dark-background layout
- Skip the closing slide — it makes the deck feel unfinished
- Put long paragraphs in body/caption fields — text overflows the container

---

## QA

1. Self-check: no placeholder text (`lorem ipsum`, `[title here]`) remains
2. Tell the user to open the `.deck` in Figma Desktop to catch rendering issues
3. Offer to fix anything they report

---

## Critical Format Rules

- Blank text must be `" "` (space), never `""` — empty string crashes Figma
- Image overrides need both a full-image hash and thumbnail hash (40-char hex SHA-1)
- Removed nodes: set `phase: 'REMOVED'`, never delete from `nodeChanges`
- Chunk 1 of `canvas.fig` must be zstd-compressed
- `thumbHash` must be `new Uint8Array(0)`, never `{}`
