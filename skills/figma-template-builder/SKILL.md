# Figma Template Builder

Use this skill when the goal is to build or refine the template itself. For the common workflow of taking an existing template and producing a new presentation, use `skills/figma-slides-creator/SKILL.md`.

## MCP First

In Claude Cowork, keep template authoring inside the MCP plugin.

- Do not inspect the installed `openfig` package to discover template features.
- Do not write direct Node.js scripts for draft creation, annotation, wrapping, or instantiation when MCP tools exist for those steps.
- Prefer `openfig_create_template_draft`, `openfig_annotate_template_layout`, `openfig_publish_template_draft`, and `openfig_list_template_layouts`.

Only fall back to direct library code if the MCP server is unavailable or the required capability is missing from the MCP surface.

## Skill Boundary

Use this skill when the deliverable is a reusable template, not a one-off deck.

Stay here when the user wants to:

- translate reference images or screenshots into template layouts
- create a new layout family
- define placeholder semantics for later sessions
- turn an ordinary deck into a reusable template

Hand off to `skills/figma-slides-creator/SKILL.md` once the template exists and the task becomes simple content population.

## Core Model

Template work happens in two states:

- Draft template: `SLIDE_ROW -> SLIDE -> ...`
- Published or publish-like template: `SLIDE_ROW -> MODULE -> SLIDE -> ...`

Draft templates are easier to author. Publish-like wrapping is the final step before later instantiation.

## Design-First Workflow

When the user provides reference images, screenshots, or example decks:

1. Read the references first and infer the layout family before touching the `.deck`.
2. Decide which parts are reusable structure versus one-off sample content.
3. Create only the smallest set of layouts that captures the system.
4. Use semantic slot names so later sessions can populate them without re-reading the design intent.

Do not mirror every visual variation as its own layout unless the content structure changes materially.

## Naming Conventions

Always use explicit metadata when authoring reusable layouts:

- Layouts: `layout:<name>`
- Text slots: `slot:text:<name>`
- Image slots: `slot:image:<name>`
- Decorative fixed imagery: `fixed:image:<name>`

These conventions are how later sessions discover what is editable.

Prefer semantic names over visual or auto-generated names.

Good:

- `title`
- `subtitle`
- `hero_image`
- `device_screen_primary`
- `quote_author`

Bad:

- `text1`
- `frame183`
- `image-left`
- `rectangle2`

## Recommended Flow

### 1. Create or inspect a draft template

- New draft from scratch: `openfig_create_template_draft`
- Existing deck/template: `openfig_list_template_layouts`
- Structural inspection: `openfig_inspect`

### 2. Annotate reusable layouts

Use `openfig_annotate_template_layout` to:

- rename a slide as a layout
- mark text nodes as editable text slots
- mark image-bearing nodes as editable image slots
- mark decorative imagery as fixed

The tool accepts node ID maps, so inspect first if you need the raw node IDs.

While annotating:

- rename the slide itself to the stable layout name
- mark only true placeholders as `slot:*`
- mark decorative or sample imagery as `fixed:image:*`
- prefer stable semantic names over spatial names like `left_box`

### 3. Publish-wrap when the template is ready

Use `openfig_publish_template_draft` to add publish-like `MODULE` wrappers while preserving the slide subtree and internal assets.

### 4. Verify the result

- `openfig_list_template_layouts`
- `openfig_list_text`
- `openfig_roundtrip` if you want a conservative encode/decode check
- open the wrapped template in Figma Desktop when validating real upload behavior

## Practical Rules

- Prefer explicit slot names over heuristic placeholders.
- Do not assume every image fill is editable content.
- Preserve `Internal Only Canvas` assets.
- Preserve special nodes such as device mockups and interactive slide elements; do not try to recreate them from scratch unless necessary.

## Template Authoring Heuristics

- Start with 4-8 reusable layouts, not an exhaustive library.
- Reuse one layout when only copy length changes; create a new layout when hierarchy or media structure changes.
- Separate content slots from chrome. For device mockups, the screen is usually the slot and the hardware frame is usually fixed.
- If a layout has explicit slot metadata, do not rely on heuristic image placeholders for that layout.
- After publish-wrapping, re-run `openfig_list_template_layouts` and confirm the layout names and slot names survived unchanged.

## Example

```json
{
  "path": "/tmp/draft-template.deck",
  "output": "/tmp/draft-template-annotated.deck",
  "slideId": "1:42",
  "layoutName": "cover",
  "textSlots": {
    "1:120": "title",
    "1:121": "subtitle"
  },
  "imageSlots": {
    "1:144": "hero_image"
  },
  "fixedImages": {
    "1:199": "background_texture"
  }
}
```
